# welcome to my personal website! ðŸŒ…
A living documentation of my favourite work, life experiences, and photos. During the lockdown, I've spent a lot of time reflecting on my personal goals and values - and decided to put them all in one place with a website! I absolutely loved working on this, from re-creating cool css animations to iterating through design ideas on figma. Check it out here: https://jennifertsai.ca/ :)<br>
## inspiration
Funny thing is, I came up with the design idea while taking a late evening nap. It was during sunset, and I noticed how much the world slows down after the sky turns dark. These were times when I felt the most creative, focused, and alive. I also just adore sunsets and just being able to soak them in whenever I can. The sunset theme of my website reflects how we should all take the time to slow down and enjoy the little things in life ðŸ˜Š
## how i built it
Everything is coded from scratch with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I also utilized the Bootstrap framework to make the site responsive on mobile! I drew a lot of inspiration from codepen, Pinterest, and other open-source sites, too!
